Lazy way to start learning czech and get my ruby skills back by creating a language app, similar to memrise.

V1: Proof of concept with a simple console app bysing beginner czech vocabulary list.

V2: Using beginner czech vocabulary list, rails app using the beginner czech vocab list and simple ui.  Possibly move vocab from csv to database layout

To Do:
  -Incorporate leaderboard
